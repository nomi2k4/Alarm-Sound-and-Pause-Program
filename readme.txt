Alarm Sound and Pause Program:

This C++ program was written as part of my learning journey to understand the basics of C++ programming. The program produces an alarm sound 100 times, pausing after each sound to wait for user input.

Program Overview:

- Uses a for loop to iterate 100 times
- Produces an alarm sound using the "\a" escape sequence
- Prints an exclamation mark "!" followed by a newline
- Waits for user input using cin.get() before producing the next sound

Features:

- Alarm sound production using "\a" escape sequence
- Looping structure using for loop
- User input for pausing between sounds
- Clear and attention-grabbing output

How to Run the Program:

1. Copy the provided C++ code into a .cpp file
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
3. Run the compiled program:
    - On Linux/macOS: ./alarm_sound
    - On Windows: alarm_sound.exe
4. Press Enter to pause between sounds

Learning Objectives:

- Understanding basic output and sound production
- Using looping structures (for loop)
- Working with escape sequences ("\a")
- Basic user input and pausing
